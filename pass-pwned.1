.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pass-pwned
is an extension for Password Store that will check a password against Troy Hunt's pwnedpasswords API. For a multiline passfile only the first line will be checked.

Using the \fI--file\fP or \fI-f\fP flag will use the provided password hash file instead of the pwnedpasswords API.

If you want to check all of your password store entries, don't provide a pass-name.
